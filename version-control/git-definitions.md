# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It's a function that allows for saving code as changes are made. It's useful because it allows you to revert to an earlier poop state in the event of a mistake.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch allows you to make changes to code without negatively affecting the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is an update made to the code. A good message is written in present tense and concisely explains what was changed.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches are merged after the same part of the same file have been edited. Git will usually ask for help in understanding which of the changes takes priority.
