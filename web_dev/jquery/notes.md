- google for "intro to jQuery" resources, cheat sheets, etc. (5 mins)

- spend two hours with 3-5 good resources, taking breaks every 20 mins or so to jot notes into this files

The most effective strategy to me was to spend the time on Codeacademy, taking occasional breaks to research and go off on tangents when I felt the need.
